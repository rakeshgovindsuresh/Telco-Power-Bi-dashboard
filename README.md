# Telco-Power-BI-dashboard
Transforming Data into Strategic Action The telecom industry faces constant challenges in retaining customers, making churn analysis a critical priority. To address this, I developed a Telco Churn Analysis dashboard that uncovers key trends in customer behavior and provides actionable insights to drive retention strategies. 
## Key Metrics Driving the Analysis
1)Total Revenue: $16.06M from Total Charges, with an average monthly charge of $64.76.
2)Churn Rate: A significant percentage of customers are on month-to-month contracts, heavily influencing churn.
3)Senior Citizen Preferences: Many senior customers favor month-to-month contracts, highlighting the need for flexible engagement strategies.
Insights from the Dashboard
4)Contract Types and Churn:
Customers with month-to-month contracts are 6.32x more likely to churn than those on longer-term plans.
5)Service Gaps Drive Customer Exit
Lack of Online Security or Tech Support increases churn likelihood by 3.63x and 3.51x, respectively.
Fiber optic users, despite being a majority, show a 2.89x higher churn rate, signaling potential dissatisfaction or pricing concerns.
6)Customer Tenure Patterns
Churn peaks among customers with shorter tenures, especially in the first 6 â€“12 months.
7)Payment Method Correlation
Customers using electronic checks exhibit the highest churn rates, suggesting a preference for more convenient options.
